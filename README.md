## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects in Udacity Frontend Developer course, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application that is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added include accessibility features such as add image alts. I also added a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for users.

## How to install

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/ChaonanLin/Restaurant-app-project) to your local machine
2. Open the folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`


### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code.
